# RickAndMorty
App made in SwiftUI with Rick and Morty's API (https://rickandmortyapi.com/).

The app idea is to apply the concept of search filter. It already exists the ".searchable" resource, but for this app, it was used a TextField to feed a variable with a data inputed by the user. This data is, at the same time, the array read from the ForEach, and serves as a filter for all the characters listed in the Rick and Morty's API.
